# DungeonsAndJava
Final Project for ITO4131 Programming in java

It it a CLI version of a boardgame that vaugely resembles Dungeons and Java (project was not my choice). 

This is my first largeish project written 100% by me. 

Feel free to fork it, build it and play it. On hard it's actually kinda fun!
